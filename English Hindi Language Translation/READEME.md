# English to Hindi Machine Translation using OpusMT Model

This Python script demonstrates English to Hindi machine translation using the OpusMT model. It utilizes TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library for training and evaluation.

## Key Technologies and Components Used

- **NVIDIA GPU**: Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster computation.
- **Transformers and Datasets Libraries**: Used for loading datasets and transformer models, including tokenization and model training.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for training and using the transformer model.
- **OpusMT Model**: Utilizes the "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi" model checkpoint for English to Hindi translation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocesses the dataset for model training, including tokenization and formatting.
- **Model Training**: Trains the model on the translated dataset using TensorFlow.
- **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for later use.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance on a validation dataset.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Installation**: Installs necessary packages and dependencies, including TensorFlow, datasets, and Transformers.
2. **Data Loading**: Loads the translated English-Hindi dataset from the "cfilt/iitb-english-hindi" dataset.
3. **Tokenization**: Tokenizes the input and target sentences using the OpusMT model tokenizer.
4. **Model Preparation**: Prepares the model for training by defining input and target sequences.
5. **Model Training**: Trains the OpusMT model on the translated dataset using TensorFlow.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model's performance on a validation dataset.
7. **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for future use.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/adityach_007/english-to-hindi-translation.git

cd english-to-hindi-translation

# Results

The script trains and evaluates the OpusMT model for English to Hindi translation on the SAMSum dataset. Here are the key results:

## Training Performance

- **Training Loss**: The loss value during model training provides insights into the model's convergence and learning progress. Lower loss values indicate better convergence.
- **Training Time**: The time taken to train the model can vary depending on factors such as dataset size, model complexity, and hardware resources.
- **Training Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model on the training dataset indicates how well it has learned to translate English sentences to Hindi.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Validation Loss**: The loss value on the validation dataset helps assess the model's generalization performance. Similar to training loss, lower values are desirable.
- **BLEU Score**: The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score measures the similarity between the model's generated translations and the reference translations in the validation dataset. Higher BLEU scores indicate better translation quality.
- **ROUGE Score**: The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score evaluates the overlap between the model's generated summaries and the reference summaries. Higher ROUGE scores suggest better summary generation.

## Sample Translations

- **Input Sentence**: A sample English sentence used as input for translation.
- **Reference Translation**: The corresponding reference translation in Hindi.
- **Model Translation**: The translation generated by the OpusMT model. It can be compared to the reference translation to assess the model's accuracy and fluency.

## Conclusion

The results of the English to Hindi translation using the OpusMT model on the SAMSum dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the model in accurately translating English sentences to Hindi. The evaluation metrics provide quantitative measures of the model's translation quality, while sample translations offer qualitative insights into the fluency and accuracy of the translations.

These results showcase the potential of transformer-based models like OpusMT for multilingual translation tasks and highlight their importance in facilitating communication across different languages and cultures.
